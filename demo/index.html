            <p>Wine labels provide useful information to assist in the selection and appreciation of wine. Different countries
              have different standards for what information is required on a wine label. In the United States, wine labels
              are regulated by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (often referred
              to as the TTB). Some states such as California have adopted supplemental labeling laws. Napa Valley wineries
              have historically provided more information than the minimum amount required by law.</p>
