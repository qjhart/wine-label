        <p>Wine labels provide useful information to assist in the selection and appreciation of wine. Different countries
          have different standards for what information is required on a wine label. In the United States, wine labels
          are regulated by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (often referred
          to as the TTB). Some states such as California have adopted supplemental labeling laws. Napa Valley wineries
          have historically provided more information than the minimum amount required by law.</p>

        <p>Mandatory. If no brand name is on the label, the bottler's name is considered the brand. It is also useful to
          refer to the bottler's name if a winery has several brands.</p>
